# BML Project
#### Implementation of the paper ["Fast and Scalable Estimation of Uncertainty using Bayesian Deep Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04854)

## Requirements
The experiment was performed using Python 3.5.2 with the following Python packages:
* [torch](https://pytorch.org/) == 0.4.0
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) == 1.14.1

## Install

In the folder containing `setup.py`, run
```
pip install --user -e .
```

## Testing the Code

Some simple examples of how to use the code can be found in `examples`. Here you can see the switch from the Adam optimizer to the Vadam optimizer called on the same model.
