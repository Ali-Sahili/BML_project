# BML Project
#### Implementation of the paper ["Fast and Scalable Estimation of Uncertainty using Bayesian Deep Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04854)

## Install

In the folder containing `setup.py`, run
```
pip install --user -e .
```

## Testing the Code

Some simple examples of how to use the code can be found in `examples`. Here you can see the switch from the Adam optimizer to the Vadam optimizer called on the same model.
